## 🧠 Project Overview

This capstone project presents a comprehensive data science solution built from scratch.  
It involves **data preprocessing**, **feature engineering**, **model development**, and **performance evaluation**, followed by thorough reporting.

The goal of this project is to apply machine learning and data analysis techniques to derive actionable insights from real-world data.  

Key highlights:
- **Data Acquisition & Cleaning:** Ingested raw data and handled missing, inconsistent, or noisy entries.  
- **Feature Engineering:** Designed relevant features to enhance model accuracy.  
- **Model Training & Optimization:** Implemented, tuned, and compared multiple machine learning models.  
- **Performance Evaluation:** Assessed models using quantitative metrics and validation techniques.  
- **Reporting & Visualization:** Generated reports that summarize model performance and findings.

*(You can customize this section to reflect your specific capstone topic — e.g., "Customer Churn Prediction using Neural Networks" or "Logo Classification using CNNs.")*
